    <h2>Syracuse, NY Snows Into The Lead in Golden Snowball Snow Contest</h2>
    <p>Congrats to Syracuse on slipping past Buffalo and Rochester the last couple of days. All of the cities were pretty far behind what their normal average snowfall should be for this time in the season.</p>
    <p>Syracuse broke a date snow record for today already with 8.8 inches of snow being reported so far beating the old record of 5.9 inches which goes back to 1951. That was enough snow to put Syracuse in the lead in the National Golden Snow Globe snow contest also. Erie, PA was winning the National snow contest which is for the bigger cities with a population of 100,000 or more as of the 2010 census.

    <p>I think we are going to see a lot of lead changes this snow season and it looks like Buffalo is ready to join in the snowball fights this season. Buffalo is way overdue to have a decent snow season and it should be a fun one at that :)</p>
    <p>Have a Great Night All and Be Safe On The Roads :)</p>
