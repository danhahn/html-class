		<h2>Sochi 2014: Opening ceremony lights a fire for Winter Olympics</h2>

		<p>An opening ceremony both elegant and awkward and full of Russian history gives the Winter Olympics a warm note at last.</p>

		<p>SOCHI, Russia - There were human doves twirling to Tchaikovsky, ballerinas waltzing with Tolstoy, and a prolonged roar for a Russian team wearing the coolest of fur-lined coats.</p>

		<p>On a chilly night along the shores of the Black Sea, Russia welcomed the world to the Sochi Olympics on Friday with a giant embrace that was equal parts elegant, awkward and Putin.</p>

		<p>The three-hour opening ceremony at Fisht Olympic Stadium highlighted the beauty of the Russian culture and strength of the Russian spirit. But it did little to lift the cloud of uneasiness hanging over a Games that began amid protests over Russian anti-gay laws and fear over terrorism. Somehow it seemed fitting when a set of floating snowflakes suddenly transformed themselves into Olympic rings - but only four of them. The fifth snowflake never changed.</p>

		<p>That didn't stop IOC President Thomas Bach from making remarks that seemed aimed at Putin's policies, as he delivered a lengthy speech during which he said, "Olympic Games are never about erecting walls to keep people apart. Olympic Games are a sports festival embracing human diversity in great unity."</p>

		<p>The evening ended with the giant torch lighted by legendary hockey goaltender Vladislav Tretiak and figure skater Irina Rodnina, who together carried the flame outside the arena and stuck it into what looked like a giant tail section of an airplane. A glow and roar ensued and later, on their way back to the buses and trains, fans huddled around it in awe.</p>
