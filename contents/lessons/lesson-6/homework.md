The point of this homework is to build a simple navigation out of an unordered list.  The idea is we are going to build a nav then style it.

## Getting started

We are building off the homework from last week.  If your work has errors or you are just not happy with it you can use the starter file attached on the right.

## Build the nav

As we talked about in class but what is a navigation in HTML tags?  It is a list of links.  So build the correct HTML markup support the navigation.

* Home -> "index.html"
* News -> "news/index.html"
* Sports -> "sports/index.html"
* Entertainment -> "entertainment/index.html"
* Weather -> "weather/index.html"

**Note:** You will see in the HTML where the nav should go after the `<header>` and before the `<article>`.

## Adding the style

Nav

	background color -> #9D9D9D

Nav Item

	Spacing top and bottom -> 5
	Spacing left and right -> 10

Nav Link

	Text -> uppercase
	Text -> bold
	font color -> #1F346C

Nav Link Rollover

	background color -> #1F346C
	font color -> white

Please note that I left out a good number of styles and if you just do what is set above it will not work. Please look back at the notes form class.
